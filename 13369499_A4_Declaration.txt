Design Innovation:
The design innovation version of my game is a stealth game, where PacStu must tag the tourists (my game's version of ghosts) before the tourist finds them.
The tourists use flash lights to navigate the darkened version of the maze. Initially they move in random directions, however, colliding with walls will alert them of your presence and they'll move near you.
Once tourists catch sight of PacStu they will try and escape the maze. The game ends when all tourists are dead or escaped.
